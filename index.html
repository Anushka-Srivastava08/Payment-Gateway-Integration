                    Education
                </h2>
                <p class="center">Education is the single most important factor in breaking the cycle of poverty. With proper education and training an orphan is empowered to become a healthy, happy, income-producing person.We provide ICT education and vocational training to post school vulnerable youths.
                    We support formal education to orphans and most vulnerable children.Helping registered orphans and their support communities to improve the educational framework in their region is our top priority.With a good education, these children will have an opportunity to succeed. They'll be able to pursue careers and contribute back to their communities.They also receive after-school tutoring if extra academic help is needed. In addition to an education, children who are in most need may also receive assistance and basic supplies to ensure they are cared for.<br/>

                    Medical
                </h2>
                <p class="center">As of now, quality healthcare is the privilege of a well-off minority. Semi urban and rural settings still have problems of accessibility to primary healthcare check-ups and follow ups, awareness of lifestyle disorders, lack of counseling about menstrual healthcare, non-availability of medical infrastructure, among others.We aim to restore health care as a universal right by targetting the grassroots.Therapy and support for children who suffer from abuse, neglect and malnutrition. 
                    Since 2017 our in-country team at the Center has provided 6,317 therapies to children under the age of 5 suffering delays from malnutrition, neglect and abuse. In as little as six months of appropriate and comprehensive therapy their lives have been completely turned around.With our specialized strategy, we work to minimize the risk of contracting the HIV/AIDS virus in orphan children.

                    That's where we start.                    
                    When all you know is hunger it becomes all you know of life. It hollows out your body, weakening your immune system and leading to disease.                    
                     Most of us are fortunate—we don’t know what it’s like to be that hungry.                    
                    But millions of people do. Malnourished mothers give birth to underweight babies leading to a high mortality rate. The children who survive face their own battle due to a lack of food.                    
                    "Poverty is a complex issue, but feeding a child isn't" - Jeff Bridges                    
                    We want to make a difference .. even if it’s only one meal at a time. But we need your help.                      
                    To find and feed orphans who truly need our help                    
                    To make sure all donations are wisely and properly used                    
                    To carefully distribute every gift in accordance to the greatest need                    
                    To ensure each orphan is cared for and loved</p>
