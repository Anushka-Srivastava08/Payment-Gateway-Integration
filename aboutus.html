               <h4> Program intervention:</h4> The Sparks Foundation  has worked and continues to work with key individual donors.With generous support from individuals and organizations, the foundation has undertaken several community projects. Our past projects range from supporting vulnerable individuals including orphans, families and groups. We provided support to children, communities and families affected by HIV/AIDS in terms of food, clothing, building water infrastructures, children care homes and building income capacities.                
                From 2012 The Sparks Foundation  reviewed its program intervention and is now focusing more on sustainable and skills building program.     <br/>           
                We provide ICT education and vocational training to post school vulnerable youths.<br/>
                We build water infrastructures with a component of income generation.<br/>
                We support formal education to orphans and most vulnerable children.<br/>
                We provide free health clinics to the vulnerable.<br/>
                Apart from that we are involving into the community development programs also, like awareness on various communicable diseases, Malnutrition, Child marriage, Women Empowerment and Employment, in addition, that our home children parents are very illiterate and economically backward, so we make various efficient schemes and model for them to take them to next level of their life.
